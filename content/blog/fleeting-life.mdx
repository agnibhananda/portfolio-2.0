excerpt: "Life is a beautiful journey. We celebrate moments of joy, endure waves of sorrow, and spend much of our time chasing things we believe will make us happy. But how often do we pause to reflect on the deeper truth of our existence?"

In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna tells Arjuna:

>**श्रीभगवानुवाच |**  
>**असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम् |**  
>**अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते ||३५||**  

>**Undoubtedly, O mighty-armed Arjuna, the mind is difficult to control and restless, but it can be conquered through practice and detachment.** (Bhagavad Gita 6.35)

The mind clings to attachments, constantly running toward desires, lust and fears. Yet true liberation comes when we realize that everything we hold onto is temporary.

## Everything is Temporary

Imagine this: A hundred years from now, neither you nor I will be here. The names of people we admire today will fade into the background as people from new generations take their place. but the world will continue spinning, the sun will rise and set as it always has. Life moves forward. Generations come and go, and memories fade. 

If nothing lasts forever, what should we truly value?

If we accept that life is fleeting, then we must ask: Are the things we chase after truly worth it?

*Does buying the latest gadget or upgrading to a bigger house bring eternal happiness?*

*Will the number of likes on our social media posts matter when we’re gone?*

We often get so caught up in these things that we forget to ask whether they bring real meaning to our lives.

Society teaches us that success means accumulating wealth, status, and recognition. We push ourselves to earn more, buy more, and achieve more. But what happens when we reach the end of our lives?

A life spent chasing only material success is like building a sandcastle at the shore. It may look grand for a moment, but eventually, the waves will wash it away, leaving no trace behind.

On the other hand, a life lived with purpose is like planting a tree. Long after we’re gone, it will continue to grow, providing shade for future generations.


## The Art of Letting Go

One of life’s great paradoxes is that true freedom comes from letting go. When we detach ourselves from outcomes, possessions, and even our own ego, we experience a deep sense of inner peace.

This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have goals or ambitions. It simply means we should pursue them with a light heart, understanding that they do not define our worth. Letting go is not about giving up it’s about moving forward without unnecessary burdens.

At the end of the day, a life well-lived isn’t measured by wealth or status. It’s measured by the love we share, the kindness we extend, and the wisdom we gain. It’s about the stories we leave behind not in history books, but in the hearts of those we touch.

True fulfillment doesn’t come from what we own, it comes from how we live.
